# Brutal Poetry of Archiving

If [Ubuweb](https://www.ubu.com) is an archive of concrete poetry, this repository is brulist poetry. It elevates the entropic form of
freestyle anacronicsic coding of text and attempts to provide organization with sharp lines, smooth surfaces
and precision molded materlal forms. Through this reforming of the contents, many of the duplicates, broken links and typos are fixed.

The brualist form opines on the taxonomy of the primary text, providing a fresh shape for others to use
for education, entertainment and collective spaces. As a direct challenge to the author's belief that SQL databases are garbage[citation needed], it provides an interface to mirror all of Ubuweb's contents into a SQL database.

The current state of the code mirrors everything available from the film section. More sections will come online as the boutique HTML is parsed, collected, understood and re-formed into something helpful to both our human and machine counterparts.

The code functions to be aggressive but not repetitive. It only downloads new contents once. It abstracts when the primary source does not. It maps the conventions found in the psychogeography or each artist's works into objects of data to be used arbitrarily. When there is javascript to obsfucate links, it will guess right.

For more context, see this interview with [Kenneth Goldsmith](https://vimeo.com/60377169) for some of the motivation to create this work.
