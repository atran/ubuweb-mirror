# Brutal Poetry of Archiving

If Ubuweb is an archive of concrete poetry, this repository is brulist poetry. It takes the entropic form of
freestyle anacronicsic coding of text and attempts to provide organization with sharp lines, smooth surfaces
and precision molded materlal forms. Through this reforming of the contents, many of the duplicates, broken links and typos are fixed.

The brualist form opines on the taxonomy of the original's author, providing a fresh shape for others to use
for education, entertainment and collective space. As a direct challenge to the author's belief that SQL databases are garbage, it provides an interface to mirror all of Ubuweb's contents into a SQL database.

The current state mirrors everything available from the film section. More sections will come online as the boutique HTML is parsed, collected, understood and re-formed into something helpful to both out human and machine counterparts.

The code functions to be aggressive but not repetitive. It only downloads new contents once. It abstracts when the primary source does not.

For more context, see this interview with [Kenneth Goldsmith](https://vimeo.com/60377169) for some of the motivation to create this work.
